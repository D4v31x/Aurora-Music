# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance and animation improvements made to Aurora Music.

## Animation Optimizations

### 1. Animation Constants
- Created `lib/constants/animation_constants.dart` to standardize animation durations and curves
- Consistent timing: fast (200ms), normal (300ms), slow (400ms), page transitions (600ms)
- Standardized curves: easeInOut, easeOutQuart, easeInOutCubic, linear
- Consistent movement distances and opacity values

### 2. Shared Animation Components
- Optimized `lib/screens/onboarding/shared_animations.dart`
- Added RepaintBoundary widgets to prevent unnecessary repaints
- Consolidated duplicate animation code across onboarding screens
- Consistent animation patterns for headings, dividers, subtitles, content, and buttons

### 3. RepaintBoundary Widgets
- Added RepaintBoundary to complex animations and widgets that rarely change
- Splash screen: Added to background images and Lottie animations
- Onboarding screens: Added to individual animated elements
- Artwork cache: Added to artwork containers
- Glassmorphic containers: Added to expensive blur effects

## Performance Improvements

### 1. Splash Screen Optimizations
- Batched setState() calls to reduce UI rebuilds
- Optimized shader warmup with smaller canvas size and reduced blur sigma
- Faster initialization timing with reduced delays
- Used animation constants for consistent timing

### 2. Artwork Cache Service
- Added LRU (Least Recently Used) cache eviction
- Memory limits: 100 songs, 100 image providers, 50 artists
- Reduced timeout from 5s to 3s for better responsiveness
- Proper access order tracking to prevent memory leaks

### 3. AutoScrollText Widget
- Better timer management with proper cleanup
- Reduced animation duration for better responsiveness (2.5s instead of 3s)
- Added RepaintBoundary for expensive text scrolling
- Proper disposal of all timers and controllers

### 4. Background and UI Components
- Optimized glassmorphic container with RepaintBoundary
- Faster background transitions (400ms instead of 500ms)
- RepaintBoundary for gradient backgrounds

## Memory Management

### 1. Animation Controllers
- Verified proper disposal in all StatefulWidgets
- Added timer cleanup in AutoScrollText
- Proper resource management in cache services

### 2. Cache Management
- LRU eviction prevents unlimited memory growth
- Access order tracking for efficient cache management
- Clear separation between artwork and artist caches

## Widget Interference Prevention

### 1. RepaintBoundary Usage
- Isolated expensive animations from other UI updates
- Prevented cascade repaints in complex widget trees
- Better performance during simultaneous animations

### 2. Animation Coordination
- Consistent timing prevents conflicting animations
- Proper animation state management in onboarding screens
- Better transition coordination between screens

## Results

These optimizations provide:
- ✅ Consistent, fluid animations across the app
- ✅ Reduced memory usage with LRU caching
- ✅ Faster initialization and transitions
- ✅ Better performance during complex animations
- ✅ Prevented widget interference and unnecessary repaints
- ✅ Improved code maintainability with shared components
